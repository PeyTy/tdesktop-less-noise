![Screenshot](demo.png?raw=true)

I made Telegram Desktop language pack to make me feel less overwhelmed by useless letters screaming at me from everywhere. Replaced to emoji or totally removed some texts.

## Setup

[Download language pack.](https://github.com/PeyTy/tdesktop-less-noise/blob/master/lang.strings?raw=true) Hold **Alt+Shift** and click on the language selection list in settings.
